USAGE

In your terminal, enter "ruby actorinfo.rb". Upon the start of the application you will be welcomed by a welcome text appearing in the console. You will  be requested to begin by entering your name and the name of an actor of your choice. The console will be able to accept only full names of male actors, of the age of 40 years old or below. This initial data will then be used to create and save an account for you, in the system, in the form of a class instance. Beyond this stage, the application will be guiding you through the services that it offers, to which you can respond to/select by entering specific answers directly into the console. The accepted answers have been predefined and will be shown to you through the text in the console.
